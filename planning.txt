Done:
-- add support for setter/getter fields with @Update.
-- fix collection persistence for facade collections (setter call at the end) with @Update.
-- check select for postgres embedded id autocompleteId with id and count.
-- maxResults und firstResult for all filter requests and list all.
-- add object query param to autocomplete.
-- support for filter in embedded id oder sub entitites (ex id.key1=abcd).
-- optimize and extend query parameter filter.
-- refactor postFilterContentInAsList with Map<String,List<Object>>.
-- optimize has Field method and move in ClassReflector (was optimized so good that wasn't needed anymore) - deleted.
-- add length to @Update.
-- add equals for update fields (implement equals method for test).
-- remove @NotNull on static methods (see build log)
-- add support for @Column nullable, insertable and updatable.
-- add findby id query
-- add order by id in autocomplete by id
-- add base class for AbstractTest

- add better field producer for string with english words
- add separate classes for read services and write services/separate delete/function switch
- add support for Ag Grid
