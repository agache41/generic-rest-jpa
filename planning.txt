- add params :
-- add support for setter/getter fields with update
-- fix collection persistence for facade collections (setter call at the end)
-- check select for postgres embedded id autocompleteId with id and count
- add separate classes for read services and write services
- separate delete
- optimize has Field method and move in ClassReflector
- add length to @Update
- implement equals method for test
- read me update
